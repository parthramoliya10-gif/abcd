// utilities with the SAME class names as Tailwind's, marked !important
// (see global.css's note on this) — those were silently overriding the
// inline glass background/border passed in by StatCard.jsx and
// DashboardPage.jsx's Quick actions/Recent inquiries/skeleton cards,
// which is why they rendered as opaque light cards instead of the dark
// glass AnalyticsWidget already showed correctly (it doesn't use Card.jsx,
// so it never had a colliding 'bg-white' class to begin with). Default
// (glass=false) is byte-for-byte the original behavior — every other
// Card usage across the app is unaffected.
